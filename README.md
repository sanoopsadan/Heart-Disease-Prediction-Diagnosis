# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Diagnosis
Capstone project from simplilearn - PREDICTION USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION.
Project 1 : Determine and examine factors that play a significant role in increasing the rate of heart attacks. Also, use the findings to create and predict a model .

**Project Task: Week 1**

*Importing, Understanding, and Inspecting Data :*

- Perform preliminary data inspection and report the findings as the structure of the data, missing values, duplicates, etc.

- Based on the findings from the previous question, remove duplicates (if any) and treat missing values using an appropriate strategy.

- Get a preliminary statistical summary of the data. Explore the measures of central tendencies and the spread of the data overall.

**Performing EDA:**

- Identify the data variables which might be categorical in nature. Describe and explore these variables using appropriate tools. For example: count plot.

- Study the occurrence of CVD across different ages.

- Can we detect heart attack based on anomalies in resting blood pressure of the patient?

- Study the composition of overall patients w.r.t . gender.

**Project Task: Week 2**

*Performing EDA and Modeling:*

- Describe the relationship between cholesterol levels and our target variable.

- What can be concluded about the relationship between peak exercising and occurrence of heart attack?

- Is thalassemia a major cause of CVD? How are the other factors determining the occurrence of CVD?

- Use a pair plot to understand the relationship between all the given variables.

- Perform logistic regression, predict the outcome for test data, and validate the results by using the confusion matrix.
